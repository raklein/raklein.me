<p>Our prior work demonstrated that <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01481-w#citeas">5-10% of open datasets contain potential privacy violations</a>, so we developed a tool to help. <a href="(https://libscie.github.io/datacheck-website/)">DataCheck</a> can automatically scan a dataset and flag 14 types of common privacy violations before a researcher makes their data public. Available as both a <a href="https://libscie.github.io/datacheck-website/">Web app</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/libscie/datacheck">R package</a>, the tool runs locally so there is no risk of exposing participant data during the scan. It was validated on both live and simulated datasets to be &gt;98% accurate.</p>
