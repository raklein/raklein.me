Trying out a new webpage design. This is built in the 'blogdown' R package, uploaded to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/raklein/raklein.me), then served to web with Netlify. Credit to the [Hugo Tranquilpeak](https://github.com/kakawait/hugo-tranquilpeak-theme) theme.

```{r cars}
mean(cars$speed)
fit <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)
fit
```
