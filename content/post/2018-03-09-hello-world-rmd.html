<p>This is a work-in-progress, but hopefully this will be my new personal page. This is built through the blogdown R package, and published through GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>As a quick example, we can do cool stuff like embed R output:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(cars$speed)
## [1] 15.4
sd(cars$speed)
## [1] 5.287644</code></pre>
<p>More content to come soon.</p>
