```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE)

This is a work-in-progress, but hopefully this will be my new personal page. This is built through the blogdown R package, and published through GitHub Pages.

As a quick example, we can do cool stuff like embed R output:

```{r cars example}
mean(cars$speed)
sd(cars$speed)
```
