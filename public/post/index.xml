      <description>Trying out a new webpage design. This is built in the ‘blogdown’ R package, uploaded to a GitHub repo, then served to web with Netlify. Credit to the Hugo Tranquilpeak theme.

mean(cars$speed) ## [1] 15.4 fit &amp;lt;- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars) fit ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = dist ~ speed, data = cars) ## ## Coefficients: ## (Intercept) speed ## -17.</description>
